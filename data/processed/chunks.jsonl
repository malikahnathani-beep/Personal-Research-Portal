One possible mechanism for ancient nitrate deposition on Mars is through HNOx formation and\nrain out in the atmosphere, for which lightning-induced NO is likely the fundamental source.

We derive lightning-induced thermochemical\nequilibriumfluxesofNOandHCNbycouplingthelightning-rateparametrizationfromthestudyofRompsetal.\n(2014) with chemical equilibrium with applications, and we use a Geant4 simulation platform to estimate the\neffectofsolarenergeticparticleevents.ThesefluxesareusedasinputintoKINETICS,theCaltech/JPLcoupled\nphotochemistry and transport code, which models the chemistry of 50 species linked by 495 reactions to derive\nrain-outfluxes of HNOx and HCN. We compute equilibrium concentrations of cyanide and nitrate in a putative\nnorthern ocean at early Mars, assuming hydrothermal vent circulation and photoreduction act as the dominant\nloss mechanisms. We find average oceanic concentrations of *0.1–2nM nitrate and *0.01–2mM cyanide.\nHCNiscriticalforproteinsynthesisatconcentrations>0.01M(e.g.,HolmandNeubeck,2009),andourresultis\nastrobiologically significant if secondary local concentration mechanisms occurred. Nitrates may act as highpotential electron acceptors for early metabolisms, although the minimum concentration required is unknown.\nOurstudyderivesconcentrationsthatwillbeusefulforfuturelaboratorystudiestoinvestigatethehabitabilityat\nearly Mars. The aqueous nitrate concentrations correspond to surface nitrate precipitates of *1–8·10-4 wt %\nthat may have formed after the evaporation of surface waters, and these values roughly agree with recent MSL\nmeasurements.

Des Marais1,\n1Exobiology Branch, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035, U. S. A.\n* David.J.DesMarais@nasa.gov\nThe climate of Mars has been more similar to that of Earth than has the climate of any other planet in our\nSolar System. But Mars still provides a valuable alternative example of how planetary processes and\nenvironments can affect the potential presence of life elsewhere. For example, although Mars also\ndifferentiated very early into a core, mantle and crust, it then evolved mostly if not completely without plate\ntectonics and has lost most of its early atmosphere. The Martian crust has been more stable than that of\nEarth, thus it has probably preserved a more complete record of its earliest history.\nOrbital observations determined that near-surface water was once pervasive. Orbiters have identified the\nfollowing diverse aqueous sedimentary deposits: layered phyllosilicates, phyllosilicates in intracrater fans,\nplains sediments potentially harboring evaporitic minerals, deep phyllosilicates, carbonate-bearing deposits,\nintracrater clay-sulfate deposits, Meridiani-type layered deposits, valles-type layered deposits, hydrated\nsilica-bearing deposits, and gypsum plains. These features, together with evidence of more vigorous past\ngeologic activity, indicate that early climates were wetter and perhaps also somewhat warmer. The denser\natmosphere that was required for liquid water to be stable on the surface also provided more substantial\nprotection from radiation.\nWhereas ancient climates might have favored habitable environments at least in some localities, clearly\nmuch of the Martian surface for most of its history has been markedly less favorable for life. The\ncombination of dry conditions, oxidizing surface environments and typically low rates of sedimentation are\nnot conducive to the preservation of evidence of ancient environments and any biota. Thus a strategy is\nrequired whereby candidate sites are first identified and then characterized for their potential to preserve\nevidence of past habitable environments. Rovers are then sent to explore the most promising candidates.\nThe Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Opportunity revealed that water once flowed to the surface across\nthe vast Meridiani plains, creating saline lakes whose waters were roiled by ancient winds that also\nsculptured their salt deposits into sand dunes. Opportunity then drove more than 30 km to explore even older\ndeposits on a crater rim. MER Spirit found evidence that thermal waters (heated by volcanism or by\nimpacts?) altered rocks to create sulfate salts, and siliceous sinters.\nThese discoveries indicate that an early hydrological cycle apparently sustained precipitation, streams\nand lakes. Liquid water participated in rock weathering reactions, such as iron and sulfur oxidation, that\ncreated distinctive weathering regimes. Volcanism, impacts, groundwater and ice interacted at least locally.\nRedox chemical energy from volcanism, hydrothermal activity and weathering of crustal materials would\nhave been available for any life. Thus conditions might have supported life in the past, at least locally.\nThe main objective of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover is to determine the extent to\nwhich Gale crater hosted environments capable of supporting microbial life. The rover has already found\nstream gravels as well as sediments that might have been deposited in an ancient lake. The rover is now\ntraversing to Mt. Sharp, a 5 km-high mound that is located on the crater floor and that exhibits layered\nsedimentary rocks having diverse minerals (sulfates and clays) that apparently formed in the presence of\nliquid water. This rock sequence was deposited over an extended time period in diverse potentially habitable\nwatery environments. Curiosity is poised to characterize a a well-preserved rock record"}

Considered the obtained productivity and astronauts\nneeds it was estimated that by taking advantage of this technology, a culture of about 15 m3 available within\npressurized domes would be sufficient to meet the protein needs of a crew of six members.\n1.

From this diverse source material, there is a detailed discussion on the\nhabitability and biosignature preservation potential of five primary analog environments: hydrothermal spring\nsystems, subaqueous environments, subaerial environments, subsurface environments, and iron-rich systems.\nWithin the context of exploring past habitable environments on Mars, challenges common to all of these key\nenvironmentsarelaidout,followedbyafocuseddiscussionforeachenvironmentregardingchallengestoorbital\nand ground-based observations and sample selection. This leads into a short section on how these challenges\ncouldinfluenceourstrategiesandprioritiesfortheastrobiologicalexplorationofMars.Finally,alistingofurgent\nneeds and future research highlights key elements such as development of instrumentation as well as continued\nexploration into how Mars may have evolved differently from Earth and what that might mean for biosignature\npreservation and detection.

Zhou1\nAccepted: 14 May 2025\nPublished online: 2 July 2025\nThe cause of Mars’s loss of surface habitability is unclear, with isotopic data suggesting\nOpen access a ‘missing sink’ of carbonate1. Past climates with surface and shallow-subsurface liquid\nCheck for updates water are recorded by Mars’s sedimentary rocks, including strata in the approximately\n4-km-thick record at Gale Crater2. Those waters were intermittent, spatially patchy\nand discontinuous, and continued remarkably late in Mars’s history3—attributes\nthat can be understood if, as on Earth, sedimentary-rock formation sequestered\ncarbon dioxide as abundant carbonate (recently confirmed in situ at Gale4). Here we\nshow that a negative feedback among solar luminosity, liquid water and carbonate\nformation can explain the existence of intermittent Martian oases. In our model,\nincreasing solar luminosity promoted the stability of liquid water, which in turn\nformed carbonate, reduced the partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide\nand limited liquid water5. Chaotic orbital forcing modulated wet–dry cycles. The\nnegative feedback restricted liquid water to oases and Mars self-regulated as a desert\nplanet. We model snowmelt as the water source, but the feedback can also work with\ngroundwater as the water source. Model output suggests that Gale faithfully records\nthe expected primary episodes of liquid water stability in the surface and near-surface\nenvironment. Eventually, atmospheric thickness approaches water’s triple point,\ncurtailing the sustained stability of liquid water and thus habitability in the surface\nenvironment.

Its presence, if it can be\nconfirmed, may have implications for the past or current presence of life on Mars. However,\nground-based observations are severely hampered by telluric interference, whereas spacebased observations have been made with spectral resolution ill-suited for observations of\ngasses.

In low-temperature hydrogen-rich\nenvironments it is the dominant carbon-containing molecule. It is much less abundant in\nthe present-day atmospheres of the terrestrial planets where most of the carbon is in CO .\n2\nMost of the CH in the Earth’s atmosphere is biogenic, either from current life or from fossil\n4\ndeposits of past life.\nDetections of methane have recently been reported in Mars’ atmosphere through highresolution ground-based spectroscopy (Krasnopolsky et al. 2004, see Fig 1; Mumma et\nal. 2004), and low-resolution spectroscopy from Mars orbit (Formisano et al. 2004). The\nground-based spectra are severely affected by telluric features. The orbiter doesn’t have\nthis problem, but is relatively insensitive to narrow absorption lines. None of the published\ndetections is of very high statistical significance. Krasnopolsky et al (2004) reports a CH\n4\n±\nmixing ratio of 10 3 ppb (parts per billion) using a single aperture covering 40% of the\nmartian disk; they argue CH should be well-mixed in the martian atmosphere and suggest\n4\nno spatial variation should be expected unless in situ observations are made. Formisano et\n±\nal. (2004) also measured a global average mixing ratio of 10 5 ppb, but measurements of\ndifferent regions ranged from 0 to 30 ppb.\nThe origin of CH in Mars’ atmosphere in the quantities reported is difficult to under4\nstand. Nomechanism foritsformationintheatmosphere hasbeensuggested, anditslifetime\n∼\nprior to photochemical destruction has been estimated to be 340 years (Krasnopolsky et al.\n2004). CO can react with high temperature water to form CH , but this reaction produces\n2 4\nvery little CH in the interior of the Earth, and probably produces even less CH in Mars.\n4 4\nComets and meteorites may bring CH to Mars, but estimates of the average delivery rate\n4\nare well below that required to explain the observed abundance. Perhaps the most likely\nabiogenic origin of CH in Mars’ atmosphere is a recent cometary impact. The probability\n4\nof a sufficiently recent impact is small but not zero.\nThe difficulty of explaining the reports of CH in Mars’ atmosphere with abiogenic\n4\nsources has led to consideration of the possibility of methanogenic bacteria or other other\nbiogenic sources of CH . The presence of life on Mars would profoundly impact our under4\nstanding of our place in the Universe. But before such a possibility should be taken seriously,\nthe observations of CH must be confirmed with improved sensitivity.\n4\nSOFIA Uniqueness/Relationship to Other Facilities\nMethane in the Earth’s atmosphere causes strong pressure-broadened"}

Twenty percent of the telluric CH remains above the\n4\naltitude of SOFIA, but because pressure-broadened lines are 80% narrower at that altitude,\nMars’ Doppler shift will bring its CH lines out of the the saturated line cores.

The atmospheric pressure on Mars\nis so low that EXES will not resolve the lines. Infrared space observatories, such as Spitzer\nand JWST, have much lower spectral resolution, so that S/N >> 1000 will be required to\ndetect the lines. Ground-based observations in the mid-IR are prevented by the telluric CH .\n4\nBecause CH is a symmetric molecule, it has no rotational transitions and so is unobservable\n4\nat mm wavelengths.\nObserving Strategy\nA test of the reported detection of CH could be made in a few minutes on SOFIA. For the\n4\nreported 10 ppb CH abundance, typical lines in the 7.6µm CH bands will have equivalent\n4 4\nwidths\n∼\n10\n−4\ncm\n−1,\nand depths\n∼\n1% at EXES’ resolution. The continuum signal-to-noise\nper pixel for a 240 K blackbody filling the slit will be roughly 100 for a 10 second integration.\nA four minute integration would give a 5σ line detection. We will be able to bin the pixels\n3 by 2 and still Nyquist sample the seeing disk and the resolving power, giving an ∼ 10σ\ndetection of the line in 3 minutes per map position. This will enable us to look for variations\nin the CH abundance at roughly a dozen separate positions per hemisphere.\n4\nScanning an entire hemisphere to a SNR=1000 would take roughly 4 hours. At a time\nwhen the Doppler shift of Mars is roughly 10 km/s, as required to separate martian atmospheric lines from telluric ones, the martian disk will be roughly 10 arcseconds in diameter.\nThe EXES slit will be roughly 1.5 arcseconds wide and 5 arcseconds long. It is possible a\nlonger slit could be used at the cost of more limited wavelength coverage. We will spend\non order 3 minutes per slit position and nod Mars completely off the slit for a total time\n5\\n\\nSSSC DRM Case Study\nMethane in Mars’ Atmosphere: Evidence for Life or Uncertain Detections?\n00\nof 6 minutes for a single slit position.

BAZYLINSKI3\nABSTRACT\nContinued interest in the possibility of evidence for life in the ALH84001 Martian meteorite\nhas focused on the magnetite crystals. This review is structured around three related questions: Is the magnetite in ALH84001 of biological or non-biological origin, or a mixture of\nboth? Does magnetite on Earth provide insight to the plausibility of biogenic magnetite on\nMars? Could magnetotaxis have developed on Mars? There are credible arguments for both\nthe biological and non-biological origin of the magnetite in ALH84001, and we suggest that\nmore studies of ALH84001, extensive laboratory simulations of non-biological magnetite formation, as well as further studies of magnetotactic bacteria on Earth will be required to further address this question. Magnetite grains produced by bacteria could provide one of the\nfew inorganic traces of past bacterial life on Mars that could be recovered from surface soils\nand sediments. If there was biogenic magnetite on Mars in sufficient abundance to leave fossil remains in the volcanic rocks of ALH84001, then it is likely that better-preserved magnetite\nwill be found in sedimentary deposits on Mars. Deposits in ancient lakebeds could contain\nwell-preserved chains of magnetite clearly indicating a biogenic origin. Key Words: Mars—\nMagnetite—ALH84001—Life.

Because of its high surface\n0.6 area, smectite can adsorb a factor of four more methane than illite or\nchlorite, with a maximum adsorption of ~0.6 weight % (wt %)\n(Fig. 1A and table S1). Integrating through the plausible volumes of\nsmectite clay, our analysis indicates that 0.07 bar of CO equivalent\n2\ncan be stored as methane within 117- m GEL and 1.7 bar in 1440- m\nGEL (Fig. 1B).

Polar molecules are measured in Martian mudstones (10, 37) and can form abiotically in smectite interlayer spaces\n(27). In this regard, methane serves as a conservative estimate compared to the adsorption of possible compounds on clay surfaces.\nBelow 500 m in depth, the maximum adsorbed methane concentration is relatively constant (Fig. 1A), indicating that the relationship\n0.2\nbetween clay thickness and stored organic carbon is approximately\nlinear (Fig. 1B).

On\nDepth (m) Earth, the serpentinization of a 700- m- thick layer would take between 10 ka and 100 million years ago (Ma) (15). While serpentine is\nobserved on Mars today (14), the extent of serpentinization could be\nobscured by subsequent alteration of serpentine to smectite since the\nNoachian (26).\nIsotopic history\nAbiotic methanogenesis preferentially incorporates light carbon\nisotopes (13). Consequently, the conversion of atmospheric CO to\n2\nmineral- bound CH would lead to the fractionation of the carbon\n4\nisotopic composition of the surface reservoir (Fig. 2). To model the\nchange in isotopic composition of atmospheric CO for varying\n2\nGEL thicknesses of smectite clays and initial atmospheric pressure,\nwe use a Monte Carlo method (Fig. 2 and Materials and Methods).\nWe use a fractionation factor of −14 ± 3‰ for methanogenesis,\nconsistent with observations of abiotic systems on Earth [(13); Materials and Methods]. For the “lowest plausible” clay volume of 117-m\nGEL, we calculate an atmospheric enrichment of 0.4 to 1.8‰, depending on the initial atmospheric pressure of CO . The best esti2\nmate of clay volumes yields atmospheric enrichment in δ 13C of 1.9\nto 14‰. The “highest plausible” volumes of 1440-m GEL stores 1.7 bar\nof CO 2 and would enrich δ 13C by 15 to 50‰, depending on the\ninitial atmosphere (Fig. 2).\nWe place our predictions of δ 13C changes associated with methanogenesis within the constraints of the atmospheric evolution of\ncarbon isotopes on Mars. Today, heavy carbon is strongly enriched,\nwith atmospheric δ 13C measured as 48 ± 4‰ (38), while the early\natmosphere likely reflected mantle δ 13C values of −30 to −20‰ (3,\n39). Enriching atmospheric δ 13C from mantle values to present- day\nlevels necessitates an increase of up to ~80‰ over Mars’ history\n(Fig. 2B). This enrichment is attributed, at least partially, to atmospheric escape.

Schulte2\nAbstract\nWe describe the history and features of the Ladder of Life Detection, a tool intended to guide the design of\ninvestigations to detect microbial life within the practical constraints of robotic space missions. To build the\nLadder, we have drawn from lessons learned from previous attempts at detecting life and derived criteria for a\nmeasurement (or suite of measurements) to constitute convincing evidence for indigenous life. We summarize\nfeatures of life as we know it, how specific they are to life, and how they can be measured, and sort these\nfeaturesinageneralsensebasedontheirlikelihoodofindicatinglife.Becauseindigenouslifeisthehypothesis\nof last resort in interpreting life-detection measurements, we propose a small but expandable set of decision\nrules determining whether the abiotic hypothesis is disproved. In light of these rules, we evaluate past and\nupcoming attempts at life detection. The Ladder of Life Detection is not intended to endorse specific biosignatures or instruments for life-detection measurements, and is by no means a definitive, final product. It is\nintended as a starting point to stimulate discussion, debate, and further research on the characteristics of life,\nwhat constitutes a biosignature, and the means to measure them.

These data shed light on the\npossible survival strategy of desert algae to near space environments. Our results indicated that Mars-like near\nspace conditions represent an extreme environment for desert algae in terms of temperature, pressure, and radiations. The survival strategy of Chlorella in response to near space will help gain insights into the possibility of\nextremophile colonization on the surface of Mars and in similar extraterrestrial habitats.\n1.
